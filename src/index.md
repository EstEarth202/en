# About

Minecraft Datapacks is a community-driven Minecraft server about datapacks. This means we need a way to ensure compatibility between many datapacks to create a stable and friendly datapack ecosystem.

## How we are going to do it

To achieve this we will use some "programming conventions", which we will ask other users to follow to improve compatibility between datapacks. To do that, we need to create a way for users to be able to access these conventions conveniently. That is the aim of this website.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute to this project, you can do it via [this Github repository](https://github.com/mc-datapacks).

As of right now, there are 3 types of contribution: **Grammar Contributions**, **Tips Contributions** and **Convention Contributions**.

1. A **Grammar Contribution** is a simple grammar correction pull-request, anyone can make this contribution if they notice grammar errors.
2. A **Tips Contribution** is a contribution to the "tips" section of this repository, similar to **Grammar Contributions** you just need to make a pull-request and wait for approval.
3. A **Convention Contribution** is a contribution to the "conventions" section of this repository. To contribute to the conventions, please read the below section.

### Convention Contribution

To contribute to the official conventions, you must first create an issue with the `Convention Suggestion` label in this format:

1) explanation of the convention.
2) explanation on how to implement it.
3) explanation of why it should be added.

After that, we will discuss it, modify it, then vote on whether to add it or not. If the vote passed you can then submit a pull-request and wait for approval.
