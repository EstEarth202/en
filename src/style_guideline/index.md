# Style Guideline

The guideline is an extension of the certified datapacks system. It contains information about how you should design a datapack for consistency with other datapacks.

Following this guideline will not necessarily improve compatibility between datapacks, but it will improve consistency in design between datapacks.

The guideline is separated into multiple pages for readability, you can find them here:

- [Datapack Advancement](./datapack_advancement.md)
- [Datapack Uninstallation](./datapack_uninstallation.md)
- [Reloading Message](./reloading_message.md)
